September is World Translation Month. Our charity has an entire team of developers translating freeCodeCamp's 9,000+ courses into so many world languages. Spanish, Portuguese, Swahili, Korean, Arabic, Ukrainian, and more. There is still so much work to be done. You can help us make these learning resources available to speakers of all languages by becoming a donor: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate
